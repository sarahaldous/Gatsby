This site was made to practice doing several different things in Gatsby. 

Initially, it was just the culmination of doing all of the main Gatsby tutorials to learn that technology. This project specifically required making a blog website that displayed Markdown pages as blog posts. 

Additionally, this site includes two counters: a regular and a hooks counter. They do the exact same, but one does so with a constructor function, and the other with React hooks.

The biggest thing we were testing out for purposes of the website that is being made is connecting Airtable to Gatsby in order to display student projects. The Projects page takes you to a list of student projects, from very beginning to final projects in an accelerated web development program. You can filter the projects by type, and can click through to view the projects and the github repos for each one. This part required setting up a data table on Airtable, then connecting that information to the site through keys, then figuring out using graphQL how the data was organized and how to access the information to be displayed. 

The ability to add new projects is not yet fully functional.
